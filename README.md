# Gradient Descent
and two examples of its use (one clear/easy, one non-trivial), and explaining how/why it works and when it can run into problems.

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for our Multivariable Calculus class, focused on explaining the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in various fields including machine learning, optimization, and physics. In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive exposition on gradient descent, covering its mathematical underpinnings, practical applications, and implementation.

## Python Implementations
easy application: `basicGradientDescent.py`\
nontrivial application: `randomSamplingGradientDescent.py`\
demo: `gradientDescentSimulation.py`

## Mathematica Visualizations
easy application: `easy application.nb`\
nontrivial application: `nontrivial application.nb`
