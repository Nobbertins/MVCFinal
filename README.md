# Gradient Descent

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for our Multivariable Calculus class, focused on explaining the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in various fields including machine learning, optimization, and physics. In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive exposition on gradient descent, covering its mathematical underpinnings, practical applications, and implementation.
